## K Means Clustering

The objective of K means clustering is to group similar data points together and dsicover underlying patterns. 

### How K Means Clutering Works:

* Start with K entroids by putting them at random place, Here K = 2
* Compute the distance of every point from centroid and cluster them accordingly.
* Adjust centroid so that they become center of gravity for given cluster.
* Again, re-cluster every point based on their distance with centroid.
* Again adjst centroids.
